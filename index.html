        <h2>About (me!)</h2>
        I'm Aashvik, and I make things! I enjoy robotics, embedded, c++, python, gaming, books, art, origami, cad, and tech in general. This site is my experiment with webdev for me to document and display my ventures. [pro tip, the footer is interactive!]

        <h2>ToDo (later!)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A TUI music player: shh, in developement!</li>
            <li>A quadruped: this time with stronger motors-- in my last attempt, I broke the gears... of all 12 motors :(</li>
            <li>A wristwatch.</li>
            <li>A D-O droid!</li>
            <li>A BB unit: 3d printed this time, since I still have nightmares of the time I tried to make one with a beach ball...</li>
            <li>A lightsaber: or two yk hehe :p</li>
            <li>A 3d printer, and slicer software: could be fun.</li>
            <li>Edith glasses: I once made a program to speak out results after looking up text extracted from a camera on wolfram alpha, but couldn't find a good way to integrate it into glasses.</li>
            <li>A 'smart' motorized desklamp.</li>
            <li>A robotic hand: I designed and printed one which had servos which pulled guitar strings attatched to curtain springs on the tips of the 3d-printed fingers. It was pretty janky but even though it worked, I didn't try to expand it.</li>
            <li>A 'hand-in-hand' clock: simple inverse kinematics for cool-looking clock!</li>
        </ul>
