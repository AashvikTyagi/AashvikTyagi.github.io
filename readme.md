This repo hosts the entirety of my website, [_aashvik.com_](https://aashvik.com), a home to my projects and a portfolio of sorts.

I wanted to write my own site and to use my custom domain with free hosting, so I made this to replace my ugly wordpress(.com) site.

Structure is simple. Including the js in any webpage will set up theming.
