This repo hosts the entirety of my website, [_aashvik.com_](https://aashvik.com), a home to my projects and a portfolio of sorts.

I wanted to write my own site, to use custom js/css, and to use my custom domain with free hosting, so I made this to replace my ugly wordpress(.com) site.

Structure is simple, with a css, index, and js file in root dir. Including js file in any webpage will set up css theming and header/footer.
