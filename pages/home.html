        <h2>About (me!)</h2>
        I'm Aashvik, and I make things! I enjoy robotics, embedded, c++, python, gaming, books, art, origami, cad, and tech in general. This site is my experiment with webdev for me to document and display my ventures. [pro tip, the footer is interactive!]

        <h2>ToDo (later!)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>A self-balancing robot: seems simple but i've never tried it</li>
            <li>A maze solver, MicroMouse style: made one for a competition but got it destroyed by a speeding biker a day before the event. I've been making another one, now entirely 3d printed, using time-of-flight sensors and n20 motors. Sadly, I keep forgetting to continue this project.</li>
            <li>A quadruped: I made and documented a quadruped insect that used 5 servos, then proceeded to make a 12 DOF 3d -printed version which promptly led to me breaking the gears of my badly-chosen and weak servos. Ah well.</li>
            <li>A wristwatch: I have a few Arduino Nanos and 128*64 displays I should probably put to use by making a watch or two.</li>
            <li>A better wristwatch: using a custom PCB, compact battery, and a screen specifically selected for it</li>
            <li>A clock: I designed, coded, and tested the circuit and model for a clock using a red led matrix display, and then forgot about it. Wow.</li>
            <li>A BB unit: I attempted to make one with my dad when I was 8 but the guy who we paid to cut the almost-ready body in half, made jagged lines, and tore the thing up from the inside. I should probably try making one again, not life size this time, and using a 3d printer instead.</li>
            <li>A lightsaber: or two yk</li>
            <li>A 3d printer: could be fun</li>
            <li>A custom, from-scratch slicer for said 3d printer: could be fun</li>
            <li>A custom, from-scratch mesh renderer and like ray caster with shadows and reflections, possibly for said slicer: could be fun</li>
            <li>Wolfestien: using said ray caster engine</li>
            <li>Edith glasses: I made a program to access a camera, capture frames from said camera, extract the text from the frames, look the text up using wolfram alpha, then speaks out and prints the result. I should definitely try to put it into a pair of glasses, or to maybe integrate it with an openAI API.</li>
            <li>A small robotic arm: I have servos soâ€¦</li>
            <li>A motorised desk lamp which follows light, or follows sound, or keeps the subject lit.</li>
            <li>A robotic hand: I designed and printed one which used curtain springs for tension and servos which pulled guitar strings attached to the tips of the fingers. It was pretty janky but even though it worked, I didn't try to expand it.</li>
            <li>Another clock: hand-in-hand style, like where one hand is connected to either the pivot or rim of the clock while the second is connected from it. We'll see. The kinematics could be fun to program.</li>
            <li>A guitar body, translucent with embedded rgb to analyze and react to different frequencies being played.</li>
        </ul>
