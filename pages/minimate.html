    <h2>MiniMate</h2>
    <section>
Minimate, developed for ATL Marathon '23 by Aashvik Tyagi and Vivaan Mansukhani, is an open-source companion robot to help people overcome depression, and this page is all about it!
<br><br>
<i>So, basically, depression, like, sucks. It's hard when you're depressed. Depression shouldn't happen. This is how we help sad people.</i><br>
Pets have proven themselves to be effective at helping people get through or even steer clear of stress time and time again, but they come with issues, including very high care and costly maintenance, which people suffering from depression may be unable to provide for. This leads to many people, including those who can afford to keep pets, being unable to do so because of the time, attention and care pets require.
<br><br>
Robot companions are much better in that regard as they don't require being fed, groomed, cleaned, or walked regularly. Our solution, MiniMate, is meant to be a robot friend, not just a pet but also a companion that helps people overcome or steer clear of loneliness and uplifts their mood in the case of depression. Even though MiniMate was originally built to be a friend and pet or those who struggle with depression it can be an amazing companion for anyone and everyone.
<br><br>
It is completely hands-free and voice-controlled, with speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities.<br>
MiniMate can be an adorable addition to anyone's life and might just be the perfect gift for your friends and family. MiniMates can not only help keep everyone's spirits high with their limitless jokes and cool dance sequences but can also connect to Wi-Fi to answer your questions and aid you in your daily life by providing recent news, weather updates, et cetera, keeping children and elders entertained, connected and happy for long periods. We've created a base (which we're constantly updating) for others to build upon. We've made multiple functions that can be modified, customised, and improved upon by others. All that we've worked on till now can be found on our GitHub repository, linked at the end of this document.
